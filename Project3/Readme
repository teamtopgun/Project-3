This project was built to read a list of items and present meaningful information to users.  I like how the menu interface works and it's simplicity.  It would be nice if the menu looked a little  different (flashy) but the code itself works as expected.  I found the use of cpp versions of the dictonary most confusing.  I'm used to using Python, so the learning curve was there for sure.   This was a good combination of reading and writing data to files.  Information I will be sure to use in the future.  I made this program adaptable and readable my following a good structure for function creation.
