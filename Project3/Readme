How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I feel that user needs should be implemented after a thourough discussion with the end user.  This can be done over email or meeting, but the user needs to be consulted before any changes are made.  User stories are a good way to communicate this with people, not just your team, but can be shared with the user to show THEM what they are asking of you

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like the idea of emhpisizing small teams and working collaboratively.  I also like how testing is given priority throughout the process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development you must be accountable.  This means being a good collaborator and communicator.  It also means to own your mistakes and be part of the change to fix them.
